# Why Does My Code Work? A Mystery

I wrote some code yesterday. It works perfectly. I have absolutely no idea why.

## The Investigation

I added a `console.log()`. Still works. Removed it. Still works. Added it back. You guessed it - still works.

## Theories

1. **The Rubber Duck Effect** - Maybe explaining it to my plant fixed it?
2. **Quantum Code** - It exists in a superposition of working and broken
3. **Stack Overflow Copy-Paste Magic** - The ancient arts

## The Solution

```js
// TODO: If this breaks, I'm sorry
function doTheThing() {
  return true // seems legit
}
```

## Conclusion

If it works, don't touch it. Ship it. Move on. Never look back.
