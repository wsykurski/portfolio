# Getting Started with Nuxt Content

Welcome to my first blog post! This post demonstrates the power of **Nuxt Content** for building a markdown-based blog.

## Why Nuxt Content?

Nuxt Content is perfect for developers who want to:

- Write content in Markdown
- Version control their blog posts with Git
- Get automatic syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Enjoy a great developer experience

## Example Code

Here's a simple Vue component:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
const title = ref('Hello World')
</script>
```
