# A History of My Git Commits

Let me take you on a journey through my git log. Buckle up.

## The Five Stages of Git Commits

### Stage 1: Optimism
```bash
git commit -m "Add feature X with comprehensive tests"
git commit -m "Refactor for better performance"
git commit -m "Update documentation"
```

### Stage 2: Reality Sets In
```bash
git commit -m "Fix typo"
git commit -m "Actually fix typo"
git commit -m "Fix build"
```

### Stage 3: Denial
```bash
git commit -m "WIP"
git commit -m "WIP2"
git commit -m "asdf"
```

### Stage 4: Bargaining
```bash
git commit -m "PLEASE WORK"
git commit -m "I promise this is the last fix"
git commit -m "Fix for real this time"
```

### Stage 5: Acceptance
```bash
git commit -m "stuff"
git commit -m "more stuff"
git commit -m "🤷‍♂️"
```

## My Actual Git Log

```
* 2a5f8c3 - "final final FINAL version" (5 minutes ago)
* 9d4e1b7 - "final version" (10 minutes ago)
* 7c3a2f1 - "done" (15 minutes ago)
* 4b8e9d2 - "almost done" (20 minutes ago)
* 1a2b3c4 - "this should work" (1 hour ago)
```

## The Emergency Commit

When production is down:
```bash
git commit -m "fix"
git push --force  # YOLO
```

## Words of Wisdom

> "Write your commit messages like the next person who reads them is a violent psychopath who knows where you live." - Someone wise

I should probably listen to that advice.

...tomorrow.
